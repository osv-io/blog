**Pop quiz: what does this graph show?**

![graph](/images/mystery-graph.png)

If you'd like a hint, here's some context.  It's from the upcoming [talk on Cassandra on OSv](http://www.cvent.com/events/cassandra-summit-2014/agenda-176f061a4b144525ae05f18cd9a9cb12.aspx) at Cassandra Summit in San Francisco.

We've been picking up a bunch of Cassandra tips at the event so far.  And we're really looking forward to (a) tomorrow's talks from the administrators of large-scale Cassandra sites and (b) showing off a new useful thing that should make life much easier for Cassandra admins who know `curl`. Which would be...everyone?

If you missed the chance to see Don Marti and Glauber Costa at Linuxcon/CloudOpen, please come see us, with bonus extra speaker **Dor Laor**.  Otherwise, you can keep up with the latest OSv news from this blog's [feed](http://osv.io/blog/atom.xml), or folllowing [@CloudiusSystems](https://twitter.com/CloudiusSystems) on Twitter.

(Next up: [Xen Project User Summit](http://www.xenproject.org/about/events/viewevent/120-xen-project-user-summit-2014.html) in New York City...)
