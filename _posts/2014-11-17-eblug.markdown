**By Don Marti**

[OSv](http://osv.io/) is the simple, fast OS platform designed to run one application in the cloud, without the complexity of old-school OSs with their local users, permissions, and sevices.  Come see what it's all about, and enjoy free food and drink from East Bay LUG sponsor, Hurricane Electric.
