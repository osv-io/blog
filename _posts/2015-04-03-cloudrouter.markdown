Interested in running the [CloudRouter](https://cloudrouter.org/) VMs that we covered in [a blog post earlier this week?](http://localhost:4000/blog/blog/2015/03/31/sdi/)  Details are available [on the CloudRouter wiki](https://cloudrouter.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CPD/Running+CloudRouter+OSv+Images). (Pre-built images are available [on the CloudRouter site](https://repo.cloudrouter.org/), or you can build one yourself with Capstan.)

Questions on these or any other images are welcome, on the [osv-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osv-dev).  For more info on working with the CloudRouter project, see [the CloudRouter community page](https://cloudrouter.org/community/).
