Want to see us build a virtual machine for the Amazon cloud at the [re:Invent show](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/)?  Come on over to our booth (K14) and we'll show you.  It's simple to add a virtual appliance build step to any application build.

Well, that took nine seconds.  What else can we do?  How about a hardware giveaway?  Since your virtual machines are going to take so little of your time, you should have plenty of time to play with a fun hardware kit.

We've got some [Raspberry Pi media kits](http://www.mcmelectronics.com/product/83-16333RK) to give away.  Not just the board, this kit includes 

 * Raspberry Pi Model B+ Board

 * 8GB Operating System microSD Card

 * Multicomp Black B+ Case

 * Raspberry Pi Power Supply

 * Wi-Pi Wireless Adapter

 * 3' HDMi Cable

 * 7' Ethernet Cable

Just the thing for a home media center, or a starting point for a more ambitious project such as a [vintage arcade](http://www.retrobuiltgames.com/porta-pi-arcade-help/porta-pi-software-os-download/).

Amazon re:Invent is sold out, but you can [sign up for streaming](http://reinvent.awsevents.com/livestream-reg.html) if you're not able to make it.
