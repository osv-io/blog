**By Dor Laor, Tzach Livyatan**

In the following demo, Dor is running 4 different OSv base virtual appliances
on his laptop:

* Redis
* Tomcat
* MySQL
* Cassandra

Each virtual appliance is a fullâ€“blown VM, each with a pre-integrated
cloud application, and each launched without terminating the others.

As you can see, application startup time takes between sub-second
(Redis) to a few seconds (Cassandra) depending on the application.
The hypervisor plus OS part of the boot time is less than a second for all cases.
