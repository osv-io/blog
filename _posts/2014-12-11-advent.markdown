OSv is on the [QEMU Advent Calendar](http://www.qemu-advent-calendar.org/#day-11) with a ready-to-download VM image.

Not just a demo, it's a fully functional Redis data store with a web management console that you can try with a real Redis application.   There are more fun projects on the QEMU Advent Calendar site, too.

Can someone make a VM that's even smaller than an OSv one?  Looks like the answer is yes.

Poor [Nyan Cat](http://www.nyan.cat/original), squashed to just 512 bytes (including a PC speaker version of the music) in the [Day 10 download](http://www.qemu-advent-calendar.org/#day-10) from Max Reitz.  There's also vintage retrocomputing, some near-future 64-bit ARM action, and more.  Check it out: [QEMU Advent Calendar](http://www.qemu-advent-calendar.org/).
