If you're attending the USENIX Annual Technical Conference, be sure not to miss
["OSv—Optimizing the Operating System for Virtual Machines" ](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc14/technical-sessions/presentation/kivity). Nadav Har'El will be presenting tomorrow at 10:40 AM.

Here's a quick preview of some of the performance results that Nadav will show:

It's also your opportunity to ask Nadav some hard questions.

If you're not at USENIX this year, you can still get a copy of the paper.

Thanks to the USENIX open access policy, the paper is scheduled to go Open Access on the day of the event. To get an alert from us when it's up, please follow [@CloudiusSystems on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CloudiusSystems).
