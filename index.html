  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>By David Jorm and Don Marti</strong></p>

<p>Most users are aware of cloud computing as a general term behind such trends as &ldquo;Software as a Service,&rdquo; where sites such as Salesforce.com can replace software run by a company IT department, or &ldquo;Infrastructure as a Service&rdquo; where virtual machines rented by the hour can replace conventional servers. But today, the technologies behind the cloud are changing the way that we connect the Internet at the most fundamental level, through Software Defined Interconnection (SDI).</p>

<p><strong>What is SDI?</strong> A lot of manual work goes into hooking up the Internet between providers. The routers that send Internet traffic from one place to another can be configured to use &ldquo;paid transit&rdquo;, where a single provider will route packets to any destination. But the more Internet traffic you’re responsible for, the more you can benefit from another arrangement, called &ldquo;direct interconnection&rdquo; where you set up your company’s routers to directly connect to another company’s. Most networks will always need to buy transit from somebody; the best you can hope for is that a portion of your traffic bypasses the transit provider and is directly delivered to the destination. Maximizing the amount of traffic that is directly peered leads to better performance, lower latency, lower packet loss, and greater security.</p>

<p>Today, most direct interconnection is typically set up manually, with a physical fiber cable connecting one organization’s network to another. Agreements to interconnect and peer are also reached manually, typically via email or face-to-face at peering conferences. When agreement is reached, network admins must ssh in to routers in order to manually configure such peering. It’s not efficient or scalable, and depends on individuals or select groups.</p>

<p>Once an organization has agreed that they want to directly connect with another organization, how do you handle changes to router and switch configuration? Probably the same way you used to manage your httpd.conf back in the 1990s! Network managers ssh in, and update config manually. Some networks have sophisticated management tools, but for many, &ldquo;the state of the router is the canonical state.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="http://www.cloudius-systems.com/images/iix_rack.png"
 alt="Software-defined interconnection"></p>

<p><em>Software-defined interconnection, under test in the IIX lab</em></p>

<p>SDI aims to improve all that. The OpenDaylight project is a common platform for network management that facilitates breaking traditional network devices such as switches and routers into separate &ldquo;data plane&rdquo; devices that handle high traffic volume and &ldquo;control plane&rdquo; devices that do management. Because the control plane device, or software-defined networking (SDN) controller, does not have the extreme throughput requirements of the data plane, it’s easy to virtualize.</p>

<p><strong>In the lab today</strong> IIX is currently prototyping this next generation of devices in the lab, while more traditional network gear runs in production. The prototype system uses an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFlow">OpenFlow switch</a> for data plane, and a separate OpenDaylight server for control plane. Switches rely on the SDN controller. In the event of an unknown packet, they forward it to the controller.</p>

<p>No configuration changes are needed on the data plane hardware, only on the SDN controller, which can be a virtual machine. OpenDaylight manages both layer 2, switching, and layer 3, routing, and the same OpenDaylight APIs can be used to change configuration at both levels.</p>

<p>OpenDaylight is a pure Java application. It only requires the ability to run a JVM on the virtual machine. For security and ease of management, it can be advantageous to run an individual controller per customer. This means a lightweight, easy-to-manage guest OS is a big advantage. With OSv, IIX can deploy identical simple VMs for each customer, and the OpenDaylight APIs can be used to configure each one appropriately.</p>

<p>OSv’s high performance and low overhead allows for high density of VMs on standard physical hardware. And any compromise or configuration error should only affect one customer, because strong isolation is provided by a standard hypervisor, without the <a href="http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2014/09/yet-another-reason-containers-don-t-contain-kernel-keyrings/">complex security model of containerization</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> While Internet applications have gained from cloud technologies, the fundamental lower layers are still coming up to speed. OpenDaylight and OSv are bringing cloud economics to the lower levels of the stack.</p>

<time datetime="2015-02-20T06:54:23-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 20<span>th</span>, 2015</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, we are releasing Seastar, a new open-source C++
framework for extreme high-performance applications
on OSv and Linux. Seastar brings a 5x throughput
improvement to web-scale workloads, at millions of
transactions per second on a single server, and is
optimized for modern physical and virtual hardware.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.seastar-project.org/img/memcache.png" alt="seastar Memcache graph" /></p>

<p><em>Benchmark results are available from the <a href="http://www.seastar-project.org/">new Seastar
project site</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Today’s server hardware is <a href="http://danluu.com/new-cpu-features/">substantially different</a> from
the machines for which today’s server software
was written.</strong> Multi-core design and complex
caching now require us to make new assumptions to
get good performance.  And today’s more complex
workloads, where many microservices interact to
fulfil a single user request, are driving down the
latencies required at all layers of the stack. On
new hardware, the performance of standard workloads
depends more on locking and coordination across cores
than on performance of an individual core. And the
full-featured network stack of a conventional OS can
also use a majority of a server’s CPU cycles.</p>

<p><strong>Seastar reaches linear scalability,</strong> as a
function of core count, by taking a shard-per-core
approach. SeaStar tasks do not depend on synchronous
data exchange with other cores which is usually
implemented by compare-exchange and similar locking
schemes. Instead, each core owns its resources (RAM,
NIC queue, CPU) and exchanges async messages with
remote cores. Seastar includes its own user-space
network stack, which runs on top of <a href="http://dpdk.org/">Data Plane
Development Kit</a> (DPDK). All
network communications can take place without system
calls, and no data copying ever occurs. SeaStar is
event-driven and supports writing non-blocking,
asynchronous server code in a straightforward
manner that facilitates debugging and reasoning
about performance.</p>

<p>Seastar is currently focused on high-throughput,
low-latency network applications. For example,
it is useful for NoSQL servers, for data caches
such as memcached, and for high-performance HTTP
serving. Seastar is available today, under the Apache
license version 2.0.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>By Nadav Har&#8217;El</strong></p>

<p>What will the IaaS cloud of the future look like? How can we improve the
hypervisor to reduce the overhead it adds to virtual machines? How can we
improve the operating system on each VM to make it faster, smaller, and
more agile? How do we write applications that run more efficiently and
conveniently on the modern cloud? How can we run on the cloud applications
which traditionally required specialized hardware, such as supercomputers?</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/mikelangelo.png" alt="Project Mikelangelo" /></p>

<p>Cloudius Systems, together with eight leading industry and university
partners, announced this month the <a href="http://mikelangelo.uni-goettingen.de/">Mikelangelo</a> research project, which
sets out to answer exactly these questions. Mikelangelo is funded by the
European Union&rsquo;s flagship research program, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/">&ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>Cloudius Systems brings to this project two significant technologies:</p>

<p>The first is OSv, our efficient and light-weight operating-system kernel
optimized especially for VMs in the cloud. OSv can run existing Linux
applications, but often with significantly improved performance and lower
memory and disk footprint.</p>

<p>Our second contribution to the cloud of the future is Seastar, a new
framework for writing complex asynchronous applications while achieving
optimal performance on modern machines. Seastar could be used to write
the building blocks of modern user-facing cloud applications, such as
HTTP servers, object caches and NoSQL databases, with staggering
performance: Our prototype implementations already showed a 4-fold
increase in server throughput compared to the commonly used alternatives,
and linear scalability of performance on machines with up to 32 cores.</p>

<p>The other companies which joined us in the Mikelangelo project are
an exciting bunch, and include some ground-breaking European (and global)
cloud researchers and practicioners:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://mikelangelo.uni-goettingen.de/?page_id=148">Huawei</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://mikelangelo.uni-goettingen.de/?page_id=132">IBM</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://mikelangelo.uni-goettingen.de/?page_id=128">Intel</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://mikelangelo.uni-goettingen.de/?page_id=124">The University of Stuttgart&rsquo;s supercomputing center (HLRS)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://mikelangelo.uni-goettingen.de/?page_id=108">The University of Goettingen&rsquo;s computing center (GWDG)</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://mikelangelo.uni-goettingen.de/?page_id=144">Ben Gurion University</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://mikelangelo.uni-goettingen.de/?page_id=118">XLAB</a>, the coordinator of the project</p>

<p>&nbsp;&bull; <a href="http://mikelangelo.uni-goettingen.de/?page_id=136">Pipistrel</a>, a light aircraft manufacturer</p>

<p>Pipistrel&rsquo;s intended use case, of moving HPC jobs to the cloud, is
particularly interesting. Pipistrel is an innovative manufacturer of
light aircraft that holds <a href="http://www.pipistrel.si/media/achievements-and-awards">several cool world records</a>, and won NASA&rsquo;s
2011 &ldquo;Green Flight Challenge&rdquo; by building an all-electric airplane
achieving the equivalent of 400 miles per gallon per passenger.
The aircraft design process involves numerous heavy numerical
simulations. If a typical run requires 100 machines for two hours,
running it on the cloud means they would not need to own 100 machines,
and rather just pay for the computer time they use. Moreover, on the
cloud they could just as easily deploy 200 machines, and finish the
job in half the time, for exactly the same price!</p>

<p>Last week, researchers from all these partners met to kick off the
project, and also enjoyed a visit to Ljubljana which, as its name implies,
is a lovely city. The project will span 3 years, but we expect to see some
encouraging results from the project&mdash;and from the individual partners
comprising it&mdash;very soon. The future of the cloud looks very bright!</p>

<p><em><a href="http://mikelangelo-project.eu/">The Mikelangelo Project&rsquo;s official site</a> is coming soon.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ian Briggs, Matt Day, Eric Eide, Yuankai Guo, and
Peter Marheine are conducting performance research
on unikernels, and have thoughtfully posted some
preliminary work on OSv performance.</p>

<p>The team tested OSv for DNS and HTTP, and got some
encouraging results.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/images/http-server-benchmark.png"><img src="/blog/images/http-server-benchmark.png" alt="HTTP server comparison" /></a></p>

<p>The lighttpd web server on OSv performs consistently
well up through 5000 requests/second.  And on DNS
tests, Linux can sustain a response rate of about
19000 per second, while OSv can handle approximately 28000 requests per second, with slightly
lower latency.</p>

<p>The preliminary paper is
<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~peterm/prelim-osv-performance.pdf">Performance Evaluation of OSv for Server
Applications</a>
(<a href="/blog/images/prelim-osv-performance.pdf">local copy</a>).</p>

<p>The researchers did run into a bug running OSv
on Xen, so we&rsquo;re all looking forward to helping
them track that down on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osv-dev">osv-dev mailing
list</a>.

<p>What do we have to do in <code>make clean</code>?  Delete all the files that can be regenerated that we don&rsquo;t need to keep around.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s listed in <code>.gitignore</code>?  All the files that can be regenerated that we don&rsquo;t need to keep around.</p>

<p>Hey, wait a minute. It&rsquo;s not a good idea to repeat yourself, especially for me, since I have to &ldquo;start a project&rdquo; often for demo code.  So here&rsquo;s a way to keep track of all those extre files in one place, with a few lines in Makefile and one handy git command.</p>

<p>Not just a demo, it&rsquo;s a fully functional Redis data store with a web management console that you can try with a real Redis application.   There are more fun projects on the QEMU Advent Calendar site, too.</p>

<p>We knew that spammers control a lot of bandwidth, because botnets.  So, for a long time, people thought that fighting spam by just accepting and discarding huge amounts of it would be counterproductive. The spammers get bandwidth for free, and servers are expensive.</p>

<p>There have been some interesting
projects to
try to waste the spammer&rsquo;s bandwidth by fooling the sender into wasting precious bandwidth and CPU by forcing it to retransmit packets, reorder, and retransmit them.</p>

<p>For example, see <a href="http://www.spamcannibal.org/cannibal.cgi">Spam Cannibal</a>. Other spam tarpits focused on a different part of the spam problem: trapping the address-harvesting part of the spam operation.  Address generators would build a dynamic site which has an infinite hierarchy of random pages, each containing a few bogus email addresses and links to more of these fake pages.  An example is <a href="http://www.devin.com/sugarplum/">Sugarplum</a> by Devin Carraway.</p>

<p>Sugarplum created pages such as <a href="this%20randomly%20generated%20page">http://www.devin.com/peaches/lemons</a> and this <a href="http://www.devin.com/peaches/lemons/disentangles/fingerboard">directory of people who want to buy herbal weight loss products</a> (psst. humans. Not really, just more spamtrap addresses. Don&rsquo;t tell the address-harvesting bots.)</p>

<p>But in most cases, for a long time, our only hope for fighting spam was to batten down the hatches.  Assume that the spammers control more computing power and bandwidth than we do, and just do the best we can to filter it.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/vortex.jpeg" alt="vortex image" /></p>

<p>Is that the best we can do?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>By <a href="https://twitter.com/DorLaor/">Dor Laor</a></strong></p>

<p>Everybody who uses containers has probably heard about <a href="https://coreos.com/blog/rocket">Rocket</a> by now. What does this <strike>fork</strike> re-implementation mean to the Docker community? Let’s dive in.</p>

<p>The Docker technology has disrupted the cloud and datacenter field for the past year. The speed of penetration was amazing and unmatched in the industry. I can’t think of a similar case for such fast-paced adoption of the concept. Neither AWS, OpenStack, nor virtualization were adopted that fast. What made it that attractive for our community to adopt?</p>

<p>Container technology was there for a lot of years. Even before containers, there has always been similar functionality, like Unix’s <code>chroot</code>. However, Docker really changed the game with straightforward simplicity and usability. Docker contributed the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> A basic one-liner command line: <code>docker run</code>. It masked out all of the LXC complexities and even downloaded the image if needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Straightforward image structure: It’s as simple as a directory.</p></li>
<li><p>A public image repository, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, where you can stash your images for future download, and employ an application-market concept.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Docker had become the hottest thing in tech, sometimes way too hot for reality (otherwise, why would one deploy Docker in a VM, incurring two tiers of management pain?). Beyond Google and AWS, even mighty Microsoft wanted a piece of the pie. We couldn’t believe our eyes, what an amazing meritocracy (no sarcasm). All the vendors of the world unite around one simple format.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/meritocracy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yesterday CoreOS released a fork-like bomb in the form of Rocket. The reason
is the very thing that makes Docker attractive, its simplicity, is also a disadvantage since it’s too complex to harness for security, SLA and diverse workloads.  Apparently CoreOS didn’t manage to get the Docker team to change the mainline code for it.  I guess it’s more than a NIH thing (Not Invented Here) but some limitation of its structure.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/fight-time.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This container diversity was expected although it saddens me to see it become an ugly fight:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/docker-thread.png" alt="Twitter thread" /></p>

<p>We believe that CoreOS has the upper hand when it comes to technology. Managing containers is straightforward, but these folks have the vehicle for deploying them. In addition they wrote cool distributed tools such as <code>etcd</code> and <code>fleet</code>. So while Docker controls the hub and the format, CoreOS leverages it to gain actual users (PR aside&hellip;)</p>

<p>There is nothing to fear about Docker momentum, but it has finally met a reality factor and such competition is positive for innovation and speed as well. With all the fuss around Docker, lots of good features like LXC SLA, and buildpacks (the way Heroku and Cloud Foundry handle them) were dropped in the race for Docker compatibility. It was a nice surprise to see that great minds think alike, and just as Rocket uses <a href="https://github.com/coreos/rocket">several phases</a> in container creation, we do the same for OSv. We create an image by spinning up an empty VM (on any given hypervisor) that formats our ZFS filesystem and afterwards listens on ‘nc’ (netcat) to receive a stream of files from the host.</p>

<p>One of the best things about OSv is that we enjoy the best of all worlds. On one hand, we are a library OS, as small as a single container, usually just a kernel, a runtime and an app. An OSv VM can weigh only 20MB, smaller than most containers. On the other hand, we leverage all of the hypervisor features, including live migration, multiple guest kernels on the same host, resource hotplug, isolation, SLA and more.</p>

<p>Let the battle continue as we collect the best of breed features and embrace them as we’ve done with <a href="http://osv.io/capstan/">Capstan</a>, with our <a href="http://osv.io/blog/blog/2014/08/28/wiki-watch-cloud-init/">cloud-init integration</a>, with our <a href="http://osv.io/manageability/">RESTful APIs</a> and more.</p>
