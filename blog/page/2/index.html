  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>By <a href="https://twitter.com/DorLaor/">Dor Laor</a></strong></p>

<p>Everybody who uses containers has probably heard about <a href="https://coreos.com/blog/rocket">Rocket</a> by now. What does this <strike>fork</strike> re-implementation mean to the Docker community? Let’s dive in.</p>

<p>The Docker technology has disrupted the cloud and datacenter field for the past year. The speed of penetration was amazing and unmatched in the industry. I can’t think of a similar case for such fast-paced adoption of the concept. Neither AWS, OpenStack, nor virtualization were adopted that fast. What made it that attractive for our community to adopt?</p>

<p>Container technology was there for a lot of years. Even before containers, there has always been similar functionality, like Unix’s <code>chroot</code>. However, Docker really changed the game with straightforward simplicity and usability. Docker contributed the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> A basic one-liner command line: <code>docker run</code>. It masked out all of the LXC complexities and even downloaded the image if needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Straightforward image structure: It’s as simple as a directory.</p></li>
<li><p>A public image repository, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, where you can stash your images for future download, and employ an application-market concept.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Docker had become the hottest thing in tech, sometimes way too hot for reality (otherwise, why would one deploy Docker in a VM, incurring two tiers of management pain?). Beyond Google and AWS, even mighty Microsoft wanted a piece of the pie. We couldn’t believe our eyes, what an amazing meritocracy (no sarcasm). All the vendors of the world unite around one simple format.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/meritocracy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yesterday CoreOS released a fork-like bomb in the form of Rocket. The reason
is the very thing that makes Docker attractive, its simplicity, is also a disadvantage since it’s too complex to harness for security, SLA and diverse workloads.  Apparently CoreOS didn’t manage to get the Docker team to change the mainline code for it.  I guess it’s more than a NIH thing (Not Invented Here) but some limitation of its structure.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/fight-time.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This container diversity was expected although it saddens me to see it become an ugly fight:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/docker-thread.png" alt="Twitter thread" /></p>

<p>We believe that CoreOS has the upper hand when it comes to technology. Managing containers is straightforward, but these folks have the vehicle for deploying them. In addition they wrote cool distributed tools such as <code>etcd</code> and <code>fleet</code>. So while Docker controls the hub and the format, CoreOS leverages it to gain actual users (PR aside&hellip;)</p>

<p>There is nothing to fear about Docker momentum, but it has finally met a reality factor and such competition is positive for innovation and speed as well. With all the fuss around Docker, lots of good features like LXC SLA, and buildpacks (the way Heroku and Cloud Foundry handle them) were dropped in the race for Docker compatibility. It was a nice surprise to see that great minds think alike, and just as Rocket uses <a href="https://github.com/coreos/rocket">several phases</a> in container creation, we do the same for OSv. We create an image by spinning up an empty VM (on any given hypervisor) that formats our ZFS filesystem and afterwards listens on ‘nc’ (netcat) to receive a stream of files from the host.</p>

<p>One of the best things about OSv is that we enjoy the best of all worlds. On one hand, we are a library OS, as small as a single container, usually just a kernel, a runtime and an app. An OSv VM can weigh only 20MB, smaller than most containers. On the other hand, we leverage all of the hypervisor features, including live migration, multiple guest kernels on the same host, resource hotplug, isolation, SLA and more.</p>

<p>Let the battle continue as we collect the best of breed features and embrace them as we’ve done with <a href="http://osv.io/capstan/">Capstan</a>, with our <a href="http://osv.io/blog/blog/2014/08/28/wiki-watch-cloud-init/">cloud-init integration</a>, with our <a href="http://osv.io/manageability/">RESTful APIs</a> and more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>By Nadav Har&#8217;El</strong></p>

<p>In a typical lab network configuration, one cannot just <code>ssh</code> or <code>scp</code> to the hosts behind the firewall (our company calls them after characters from Norse mythology: Loki, Muninn and friends).  Instead, you need to ssh to a bastion host, and from there connect to the internal systems.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/ssh-user.jpeg" alt="ssh user" /><br><em>an ssh user connecting using a bastion host</em></p>

<p>One can automate these two steps, with a command like</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ssh -t bastion.example.com ssh loki.lab.example.com</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And I guess some of you are already doing that. But this only works for ssh, not scp. One can do scp through an &ldquo;ssh tunnel&rdquo;, but this is really ugly to set up every time and to use.</p>

<p>There is also a securty hole in this approach, because anyone who breaks into <code>bastion</code> (which is an external machine and thus exposed to the Internet) can then ssh from there to all the internal machines, or even hijack already-running ssh sessions.</p>

<p>I finally found a much better solution, much easier to use and much more secure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cloudius Systems is introducing an early access version of OSv, the lightweight open-source OS optimized for large cloud workloads, on November 13.  <a href="http://osv.io/beta-release/">Beta program information</a> is now available.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.cloudius-systems.com/images/mouse.jpeg" alt="lab mouse" /></p>

<p>OSv can be used to minimize latency and reduce TCO for many workloads, especially horizontally scaled ones. The software is available as ready-to-run virtual machine images pre-configured to run popular NoSQL data stores such as Redis and Apache Cassandra, as well as in source code form.</p>

<p>“OSv lets you take a project from a developer’s IDE to a flexible, multi-server deployment much faster,” said Dor Laor, CEO of Cloudius Systems.  “As customers require more and more throughput at lower and lower operating cost, we enable developers to use the agility of containers along with the proven security and management features known for in virtual machines.”</p>

<p>Cloudius Systems’ early access release features an expanded Web API for management, along with performance improvements that increase efficiency, with an up to a 3.9x throughput gain. Unlike conventional operating systems with their diverse configuration files and complex user and memory management, OSv is designed to provide the minimum OS needed to run a single application at maximum performance in the cloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;OSv was designed with virtualization in mind,” said Cloudius Systems CTO, Avi Kivity.  “The OS overhead is minimized by a reduction of context switches, data copies, and inefficient constructs such as spinlocks.&rdquo; OSv virtual machines can be as small as 20MB, far smaller than Docker containers, and boot in less than one second.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.cloudius-systems.com/images/mouse.jpeg">Sign up for the OSv beta</a></h2>

<p>You can keep up with the latest OSv news from this blog&rsquo;s <a href="http://osv.io/blog/atom.xml">feed</a>, or folllowing <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudiusSystems">@CloudiusSystems</a> on Twitter.  Hope to see you at the show.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>By Tzach Livyatan</strong></p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the OSv 0.14 Alpha Release.</p>

<p>This is the first release to include the dashboard, a  browser-based UI for OSv and virtual appliance status.</p>

<p><img src="http://osv.io/images/dashboard.png" alt="OSv dashboard" /></p>

<p>The dashboard includes (among other features):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Main tab with Memory, CPU, Disk</p></li>
<li><p>Thread tab with interactive visualization of thread status and thread usage.
You can select and search for particular thread by name.</p></li>
<li><p>Trace tab, including frequency for each tracepoint. Selection by name and search are available.</p></li>
<li><p>JVM tab for basic JVM information including memory and GC, when a JVM is installed.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtual Appliance tab for information relevant to the particular appliance.
Tabs for Cassandra and Tomcat are currently  available, with more to come.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>To build the dashboard, just includes httpserver in
the module list.  For example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ make -j 4 image=cassandra,httpserver</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>By Dor Laor</strong></p>

<p>If you use AWS or Rackspace, there is a good chance that you got affected by <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/09/24/yikes-big-amazon-web-services-reboot-on-the-way/">cloud-reboot</a>. Ten percent of AWS machines were forced to reboot during the weekend period due to a simple bug that created a security vulnerability. The reboot could have been prevented/mitigated through the use of sophisticated but handy tools. Such tools have existed for years but few people use them.</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at the particular problem and proceed toward a call for action for usage of additional, fantastic low-level features that are hardly being used by IaaS/PaaS vendors.</p>

<p>The cloud-reboot trigger is a tiny off-by-12kb xen hypervisor bug. A simple Model Specific Register check had a wrong limit as you can observe in the
<a href="http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/xsa108.patch">fix</a> for the <a href="http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-108.html">security vulnerability</a>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>-    case MSR_IA32_APICBASE_MSR ... MSR_IA32_APICBASE_MSR + 0x3ff:
</span><span class='line'>+    case MSR_IA32_APICBASE_MSR ... MSR_IA32_APICBASE_MSR + 0xff:</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The vulnerability allows an attacker to either crash the hypervisor or retrieve data about other tenants. It’s really a long shot since the memory probably belongs to Xen addresses but in theory one can get lucky and read someone else’s passwords/keys.</p>

<p>Kudos to Amazon and Rackspace for being on the safe side. The fix is a huge hassle and pain for such a small chance of being successfully targeted. Kudos for Xen (and the other hypervisor vendors) for developing mature hypervisors that these events are that rare.</p>

<p>Now how could an IaaS vendor mitigate the problem without a reboot?</p>

<h2>Option #1 &ndash; Dynamic Code Patching</h2>

<p>Dynamic code patch technology for running-code has been available for years. Initially it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ksplice">KSplice</a>, and
that was recently followed by <a href="https://github.com/dynup/kpatch">KPatch</a>. Lean cloud providers <a href="https://twitter.com/extramsp/status/18715823586">reported KSplice deployment for Xen 4 years ago!</a></p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/extramsp.png" alt="Cloud provider announces Ksplice support, on Twitter" /></p>

<p>XSA-108, the cloud-reboot bug, could have been the perfect candidate for this.
Hold your horses; Ksplice probably hadn’t been integrated to Xen and Ksplice is only applicable to dom-0. However, didn’t they see it coming? Now 10% of the Internet needs a reboot because no one picked it up. Let’s see whether a quick developer group will come to the rescue.  Ouch.</p>

<h2>Option #2 &ndash; Live migration</h2>

<p>Look ma, no hands&hellip;live migrate the VMs from an old hypervisor version to a patched hypervisor without service interruption.</p>

<p>At Red Hat, I managed the KVM and Xen development teams. We were heavily invested in live migration development. A great deal of thought was given to cross-release migration, resulting in the ability to migrate a VM running on KVM version x to version x+y.  Sometimes even the opposite direction was allowed. We maintained a huge matrix of migration options which included the preservation of the virtual-hardware version. This means that a KVM hypervisor can represent a variety of virtual-hardware versions (combo of cpu+devices) and keep the ABI (Application Binary Interface) compatible across KVM releases and live migration events.</p>

<p>Live migration was constantly optimized to reduce the effect on the running-workloads as well as to minimize downtime to few msecs. Smart compression, hot-page-transfer prioritization, and even more adventurous post-copy migration were deployed.</p>

<p>To my surprise, several years and millions of hypervisors later, most cloud providers do not implement live migration. That’s rather unfortunate for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Live migration allows maintenance mode.</strong> The host can be taken down while the VMs are being migrated to a different host</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamic load balancing</strong> It’s possible to over-provision resources such as cpu, network, memory, etc in order to increase virtual server density. In case of load, live migrate VMs balance the host resources. Over-provisioning can reduce the cloud-bills dramatically; for a theoretical example, check the cost of a <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">t2-micro</a> instance.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>A leading cloud provider does use live migration, mainly because it uses shared storage for the VMs and the migration is just about the VM RAM. Other IaaS vendors use local storage but the &lsquo;excuse&rsquo; does not hold since for long it is possible to live migration local storage too . Sophisticated scenarios are supported; for example, a VM template image can reside on shared storage. There is no need to copy the image to the local disk when the VM is provisioned. Instead, the VM starts execution locally while its disk is remote. On the fly the disk requests are served from the network while a background task transfers the entire disk to the local hypervisor. In a similar way, live migration of a VM with local storage can takes place.</p>

<p>Even open source projects such as Openstack and CloudFoundry do not support live migration. After all the time and effort invested in capturing the state of the virtual machine hardware state, it’s pretty sad that the feature isn’t enabled in practice and only data center solutions like vCenter and RHEV support it. Just to finalize this rant, please allow me to enclose the type of data a live migration captures:</p>

<ul>
<li>Complete configuration of the virtual hardware setup</li>
<li>State of all CPU registers (General purpose, FPU, SIMD, MSRs,..)</li>
<li>State of the interrupt controllers</li>
<li>State of the disk drive (Registers, in-flight IO, interrupts)</li>
<li>State of the network cards (Registers, in-flight IO, interrupts)</li>
<li>State of all other devices &ndash; keyboard, mouse, USB, GPU, etc</li>
</ul>


<p>Modern hypervisors manage to deal with the above complexity and send GBs of data underneath the guest execution. In turn, the cloud management software needs only to find a target host and evacuate the source host (in the case of hardware/software maintenance or a bit more sophisticated for load balancing needs). This is a fair deal, now please, go implement it.</p>

<h2>&lt;wake up call continues></h2>

<p>Since I started with two important OS features that aren’t implemented (dynamic patching and live migration), let me add to the list the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hot (un) plug of memory and cpu</strong> This is a pure scale-up scenario. You start a small VM and if there is a need, add virtual CPUs and/or memory to the mix. Most OS’s and hypervisors support it.  Imagine you run a c3.8xlarge during the day, and at night you unplug resources to form a c3.large VM which costs 1/16 as much.</li>
</ul>


<p>Imagine you’re running a JVM application that needs an immediate garbage collection (GC). Today, the application will experience a Stop-The-World phase which will translate into downtime that can go up to several seconds (a function of heap size).  Instead, such a VM can ask to hot plug additional RAM and CPUs 1 second before it really needs to pause. The JVM may use even a silly copy garbage collector to copy the live objects from the original RAM block to newer hotplugged-RAM blocks and unplug the old block entirely (using the extra vCPUs to accelerate the action).</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Trusted boot/computing</strong> Trusted Computing is a technology to keep the integrity of an operating system, which is based on a secure chip such as “TPM (Trusted Platform Module)” and/or Intel’s TXT technology: Trusted Execution Technology provides a hardware based root of trust to ensure that a platform boots with a known good configuration of firmware, BIOS, virtual machine monitor, and operating system, forming a fully signed and secure stack.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fast VM provision time</strong> <a href="http://osv.io/">OSv</a> boots in under 1 second! However it takes significantly more time to provision a VM.  If the hypervisor and the OS can boot that fast, I see no reason for the hypervisor management code to be slower.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>&lt;/wake up call continues></h2>

<p>Enough rants for one day, now let’s get back to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23osv">#OSv</a> and make it shine some more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>By Glauber Costa</strong></p>

<p>Don Marti and I will soon be presenting OSv at <a href="http://osv.io/blog/blog/2014/09/25/javaone/">JavaOne</a>. We are excited about
the conference, and thought we could give you a small preview of what we will
be talking about.</p>

<p>As you already know, OSv is at the same time an operating system, and a
library. It is as functional as an operating system, and as invisible as a
library. This means that you shouldn&rsquo;t really install your app into OSv, but
rather, merge them both naturally as a single entity.</p>

<p>If you are using Java, there is a huge chance that one way or another, your
project is built through Apache Ant, or similar tool.</p>

<p>If you have Capstan, our image building tool, that merges nicely and
beautifully with your Ant-based build process. Here is how:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>

<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
<span class='line-number'>20</span>
<span class='line-number'>21</span>
<span class='line-number'>22</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;property name="hypervisor" value="qemu"/&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;basename property="vm-name" file="${basedir}"/&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;property name="capstanpath"
</span><span class='line'>   value="${user.home}/.capstan/repository/${vm-name}"/&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;target name="vm" depends="jar"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;echo file="Capstanfile" append="false"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>base:
</span><span class='line'>   cloudius/osv-openjdk
</span><span class='line'>cmdline:
</span><span class='line'>  /java.so -jar ${jarname}
</span><span class='line'>files:
</span><span class='line'>  /${jarname}: build/jar/${jarname}&lt;/echo&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;exec executable="capstan"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;arg value="build"/&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;arg value="-p"/&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;arg value="${hypervisor}"/&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/exec&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;copy tofile="HelloWorld.${hypervisor}"
</span><span class='line'>   file="${capstanpath}/${vm-name}.${hypervisor}"/&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;delete file="Capstanfile"/&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/target&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The snippet above assumes that you already have a &ldquo;jar&rdquo; target in your build.</p>

<p>As you can guess from the image name, this example is a simple HelloWorld.  The
code, together with the complete build.xml file, can be downloaded
<a href="https://github.com/dmarti/OSvJavaOneDemo.git">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Adding that step to your existing build environment, allows you to have a first-class VM in a format consumable by QEMU/KVM. Booting in your hypervisor
of choice, becomes just a matter of editing the file for the correct format.</p>

<p>And after that? Fire up Capstan and enjoy your VM!</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[glauber@localhost JavaOne]$ capstan run JavaOne
</span><span class='line'>Created instance: JavaOne
</span><span class='line'>OSv v0.12
</span><span class='line'>eth0: 192.168.122.15
</span><span class='line'>Hello World</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Alternatively, boot the HelloWorld.qcow2 image that was copied to the local
directory, with any tool you want.</p>

<p>Glauber Costa and Don Marti are speaking at the JavaOne conference in San Francisco, on Tuesday, September 30.  Hope to see you there.</p>

<p><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=4120">OSv: The Operating System Designed for Java and the Cloud</a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re in for:</p>

<blockquote><p>A lot of the cloud discussion centers around which hypervisors are the best and which management tools will simplify our life the most. But is it the whole story? When problems are addressed from the lower and higher layers, the middleman—the guest operating system—is usually left behind. This changes with OSv, an operating system designed from the ground up to run Java applications in the cloud. OSv is a library OS. Therefore, you can think of using it as being a way to boot a JVM directly into the cloud. Forget OS management: it’s your application and the end of the story. Besides explaining the architecture, this presentation demonstrates how designing an OS with Java in mind can benefit the Java ecosystem.</p></blockquote>

<p>We&rsquo;ll demonstrate a nine-second build of a VM from a Java project.  Hope to see you there.</p>
